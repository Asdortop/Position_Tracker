# Position Tracker API - Comprehensive Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing instructions to ensure your position tracker works perfectly under all kinds of different trade inputs and scenarios.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.10+
- pip
- All dependencies from `requirements.txt`

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install main dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install test dependencies
pip install -r test_requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run Quick Test

```bash
python quick_test.py
```

This will validate basic functionality and ensure everything is working.

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing

### 1. Run All Tests

```bash
python run_comprehensive_tests.py
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Run unit tests for core business logic
- ‚úÖ Run integration tests for API endpoints
- ‚úÖ Run performance tests with large datasets
- ‚úÖ Run edge case tests
- ‚úÖ Run FIFO scenario tests
- ‚úÖ Generate comprehensive test reports
- ‚úÖ Validate tax calculations
- ‚úÖ Test decimal precision handling

### 2. Manual API Testing

Start the server:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

In another terminal, run:
```bash
python test_api_manually.py
```

This will test all API endpoints with various scenarios.

## üìä Test Coverage

   - Very large quantities (999,999.9999)
   - Zero prices
   - Negative charges
   - Exact 365-day holding period
   - High precision decimals

### FIFO Scenarios

1. **Complex FIFO Scenarios**
   - Multiple lots with different dates
   - Mixed holding periods
   - Identical prices
   - High precision calculations
   - Very small quantities

2. **Partial Sales**
   - Single lot partial sales
   - Multiple lot partial sales
   - Cross-lot partial sales
   - High precision partial sales

### Performance Tests

1. **Large Dataset Performance**
   - 1,000+ tax lots
   - 100+ concurrent trades
   - Bulk trade processing
   - Memory usage validation

2. **Database Performance**
   - Query performance
   - Insert performance
   - Update performance
   - Transaction performance

## üîç Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Trading
```
1. Buy 100 shares at $150.00
2. Buy 50 shares at $160.00
3. Update price to $175.00
4. Sell 75 shares at $170.00
5. Check portfolio snapshot
6. Verify tax lots
```

### Scenario 2: FIFO Testing
```
1. Buy 100 shares at $150.00 (Day 1)
2. Buy 200 shares at $160.00 (Day 15)
3. Buy 150 shares at $155.00 (Day 30)
4. Sell 300 shares at $170.00 (Day 45)
   - Should consume: 100 + 200 + 100 from third lot
   - First lot: CLOSED
   - Second lot: CLOSED
   - Third lot: PARTIAL (50 remaining)
```

### Scenario 3: Tax Calculations
```
1. Buy 100 shares at $150.00 (Long-term: 400 days ago)
2. Buy 200 shares at $160.00 (Short-term: 30 days ago)
3. Sell 150 shares at $170.00
   - 100 shares: Long-term tax (12.5%)
   - 50 shares: Short-term tax (25%)
```

### Scenario 4: Edge Cases
```
1. Buy 0.0001 shares at $150.00
2. Buy 999,999.9999 shares at $150.00
3. Buy 100 shares at $0.00
4. Buy 100 shares with -$5.00 charges
5. Sell after exactly 365 days
6. Sell after 364 days
```

## üìà Expected Results

### Portfolio Snapshot
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "user_id": 123,
    "total_market_value": 17500.00,
    "total_unrealized_pnl": 2500.00,
    "realized_pnl_ytd": 1200.00,

      "unrealized_pnl": 2500.0000
    }
  ]
}
```

### Tax Lot Status
- **OPEN**: Lot is fully open (remaining_qty = open_qty)
- **PARTIAL**: Lot is partially closed (0 < remaining_qty < open_qty)
- **CLOSED**: Lot is fully closed (remaining_qty = 0)

### Tax Calculations
- **Short-term**: < 365 days, 25% tax rate
- **Long-term**: ‚â• 365 days, 12.5% tax rate
- **Charges**: Proportionally allocated to reduce taxable gains

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the right directory
   cd position-tracker-main
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r test_requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Database Errors**
   ```bash
   # Remove old database
   rm local_test.db
   
   # Restart server
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

3. **Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Run specific test
   pytest tests/test_processing_service.py::TestProcessingService::test_buy_trade_processing -v
   
   # Run with more verbose output
   pytest tests/ -v -s
   ```

4. **API Connection Errors**
   ```bash
   # Check if server is running
   curl http://localhost:8000/
   
   # Start server if not running
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```
