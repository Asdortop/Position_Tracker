## Issues Found & Fixed

### ✅ FIXED: Missing Commit in Price Update Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/v1/routes/simulations.py`
**Line:** 32-33
**Issue:** Price updates were being flushed but not committed to database
**Fix:** Added `await db.commit()` after `upsert_price()`

**Before:**
```python
await crud_ops.upsert_price(db, price_update.security_id, price_update.price)
return {"message": f"Price for security {price_update.security_id} updated to {price_update.price}."}
```

**After:**
```python
await crud_ops.upsert_price(db, price_update.security_id, price_update.price)
await db.commit()
return {"message": f"Price for security {price_update.security_id} updated to {price_update.price}."}
```

## Operations Verified ✅

### 1. Trade Processing (`processing_service.py`)
**Endpoint:** `POST /simulate/trades`
**Lines:** 13-20
**Status:** ✅ Properly commits after trade processing
```python
async def process_trade(self, db: AsyncSession, trade: Trade):
    if trade.side.upper() == "BUY":
        await self._process_buy(db, trade)
    elif trade.side.upper() == "SELL":
        await self._process_sell(db, trade)
    
    await self._update_portfolio_summary(db, trade.user_id, trade.security_id)
    await db.commit()  # ✅ Commit present
```

### 2. Price Update Method (`processing_service.py`)
**Lines:** 106-108
**Status:** ✅ Properly commits after price update
```python
async def update_price(self, db: AsyncSession, user_id: int, security_id: int, new_price: Decimal):
    await crud_ops.upsert_price(db, security_id, new_price)
    await db.commit()  # ✅ Commit present
```

### 3. Read Operations (No Commits Needed)
**Files:**
- `app/api/v1/routes/taxlots.py` - Only reads tax lots
- `app/api/v1/routes/portfolios.py` - Only reads portfolio data
- `app/repositories/crud_operations.py` - get methods only read data

---

## Unused Code (Not an Issue)

### `get_or_create_portfolio_summary()` in `crud_operations.py`
**Status:** ⚠️ Unused dead code
**Note:** This function has `db.flush()` but is never called anywhere in the codebase. No issue since it's not being used.

---

## Best Practices Enforced

1. ✅ All database writes have explicit commits
2. ✅ Read-only operations don't use commits (correct)
3. ✅ Proper transaction boundaries maintained
4. ✅ No orphaned flushes without commits

---

## Testing Recommendations

After deploying these fixes, test:
1. Price updates persist correctly
2. BUY trades are committed
3. SELL trades use saved prices correctly
4. No data loss in any operations
