Price Updater Worker

This worker is responsible for continuously updating security prices
from external price feeds in the background.

PROPOSED FUNCTIONALITY:
- Connects to external price feed APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
- Periodically fetches latest prices for all securities
- Updates the database with new prices
- Triggers unrealized P&L recalculations
- Runs as a background task/scheduler

CURRENT STATUS: Not implemented
This is a placeholder for future functionality.
