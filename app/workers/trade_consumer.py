"""
Trade Consumer Worker

This worker is responsible for consuming trades from a message queue
(e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Streams) and processing them.

PROPOSED FUNCTIONALITY:
- Subscribes to a message queue for trade events
- Consumes trade messages asynchronously
- Processes trades using the ProcessingService
- Handles errors and retries
- Publishes acknowledgment messages
- Runs as a background worker/consumer

CURRENT STATUS: Not implemented
This is a placeholder for future functionality.
